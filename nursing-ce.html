            <p class="mt-3">The NBCRNA offers NCEs through their website, but lacked compatibility for mobile devices. <span class="highlight">Nursing CE needed to be built with a unique design system separate from the parent site, that encourages use with ease of access.</span> Users needed to be able to track their certificates, purchase and access courses, and take course assessments using a simple and modern interface. 

            Our goals were to:

            <ul class="pl-3r">
                <li>Create an app that displays NBCRNA’s site content in a way that is easy to read</li>
                <li>Allow users to take certification exams online on the go</li>
                <li>Create a customizable dashboard overview of user progress</li>

                <span class="highlight">Nursing CE tasked me with creating an interface that conveys their vision, inspiration and education to all healthcare professionals, in a light-hearted and frictionless experience.</span> Because my team was unfamiliar with the language and system of nursing certificate examination, I felt that a cognitive walkthrough would be a valuable step in understanding our users' intentions before we started prototyping. We had many features we wanted to make available to the users, but the end-goals of the user would be to simply access course content, certification examinations, and purchase new courses.

                <b>Creating a natural experience</b><br><br>
                To design an interface that evoked calmness, I researched design elements that may have a cognitive impact. Purple is an appropriate color to choose here - invoking the balancing psychological effects of both red and blue. While red brings intensity and energy, blue brings relaxation and stability. Color Psychology says that “purple can have calming effects over the mind and nerves, yet it can be uplifting and can trigger creativity.” A lighter purple is naturally associated with feminity, which invokes trust within the user. We used plenty of white space to increase comprehension, which nicely complemented the friction-reducing components and copywriting.<br><br>

                <b>Value Proposition</b><br><br>
                A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered, communicated to, and acknowledged by the user. We determined that value proposition must be defined during the account sign up process by communicating how the service will be beneficial to the user. After researching, we found that <span class="highlight">users typically bounce from sign up portals largely due to the fear of being spammed or wasting time.</span> Creating an account is necessary to track progress via network and work across devices seamlessly, but how can we convince our users early on? Rather than explaining the importance of account creation to users, we tried a different approach. <span class="highlight">Users are not prompted to create an account until accessing the app a third time, or if attempting to purchase an online course. This way, the user has the ability to test out the application without feeling the need to commit.</span> A user that is purchasing a course is more likely to sign up vs. a user browsing what services we offer. In both cases, we provide value by informing the user about our services, or creating access to content across devices and on the go.

            <p class="mt-3 mb-9r">
                I was involved only briefly in the development phase and in the launch phase. I did not have access to the end-users, so I was unable to perform any user testing, but performed numerous design tests after the primary prototypes were pushed for development. Nursing CE was thrilled with the final product and the new branding implemented in this project, and the team took pride in our work. Overall, this was an exciting project to work on and my first time collaborating on a bigger team as a UX designer. This project taught me several valuable lessons as a designer: <br><br>

                <b>No such thing as over-communication</b><br><br>
                To efficiently work in unison, I worked with the development team to produce a list of components and features that would be implemented into the project. We then broke the components down into a naming convention that I could design and pass on to the developers quickly. This way the developers could begin developing because we knew what to expect from one another. If a design/development change was being implemented, or even considered, we communicated this early on. We were able to work in tandem, because we were able to map out the design and development process and facilitate our pipelines. This saved us time, and also helped us understand one another's processes.<br><br>

                <b>Working with design patterns</b><br><br>
                This was the first time I worked alongside a pre-existing design system as a UX designer, though I had an idea of what to expect given <!-- past tense: previous experience -->my UI experience. I needed to rewrite a large majority of the system but I had to do so in a way that was creative, yet consistent with the elements that would be transferred over. I documented my design decisions, presented my ideas, and continued to build design patterns throughout the design process. Being given the responsibility to shape this company's future branding, as well as having an influence in future design and development phases was massively rewarding. <br><br>
