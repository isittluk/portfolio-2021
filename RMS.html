            <p class="mt-3">Most asset management firms use Microsoft Excel as their primary tool for data handling. <span class="highlight">Workbooks become congested and firms must sort through hundreds of thousands of workbooks and millions upon millions of data entries.</span> This becomes problematic over time, as file folder structure must be strictly maintained or data retrieval becomes difficult to execute effectively or even correctly. These workbooks inevitably develop errors, as the success of the structure depends largely on domain knowledge. <br><br>

            Because large file systems are maintained manually, numerous operational issues occur over time. What happens if the author of these workbooks leaves the company? The domain knowledge becomes unavailable and can be lost forever. The successor will have to relearn the current file system or change it, resulting in the entire reporting and summarization process to fail.<br><br>
            
            <span class="highlight">Our goal was to create a customized solution to easily allow the handling and updating of large amounts of data among numerous users.</span>

                <p class="mt-3r">Because this application would be handling potentially billions of data entries, I was tasked with creating a simplified data sorting experience. <span class="highlight">The majority of our users are comfortable with Microsoft Excel, so I was tasked with elevating the interface and experience in a way that does not deter existing mental models.</span>
    
                I started by researching Excels’ reviews regarding usability and focused on these common complaints:
                <ul class="pl-3r">
                    <li>Excel’s functionality is difficult to learn naturally</li>
                    <li>Large files become congested with data</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>
                <span class="highlight">To handle these two accessibility concerns, we created several sequences so that the user could view the data with advanced, optional sorting.</span> The application begins by fetching the selected data group (workbook) from the database. The user then searches by keywords or values to further reduce data provided. Afterwards, the user performs numerous sorting functions using simple filter settings. This was our first solution to simplifying the present data.<br><br></p>

                                <p>To begin, I explored different ways for users to sort through data, researching data tables specifically, and what would be considered the most useful features: ascending/descending values, cell padding, filter systems, etc. As part of my process, I detailed what I felt would be the most efficient flows and created interactive prototypes to test.</p>
                                <p>I initially tried copying components from other data tables within the project, but found that there was too much data to take advantage of what we already had. I used a more typical data table with conservative cell spacing, traditional rows and columns, and included a search bar. The table was congested and I was not satisfied with its readability.</p>
                                <p>A unique restraint to this project is that I couldn't stray too far from what the user is already comfortable using (Excel Workbooks), so I often scratched ideas that may be too unfamiliar for the user. Ultimately using a grouping and tab system created an experience that felt less like a data table, and more like a form. In this sense, I was able to be more creative with my display of data while achieving some level of familiarity.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">This was a very rewarding project for me to work on, as it provided immediate value. It involved a lot of design thinking, and left me with complete creative freedom. However, shifting responsibilities and time constraints have delayed the application release - it is still a work in progess. Still, I learned some important lessons about project processes and project management.</p>
        
                        <p><b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b></p>
                        <p>While working through the interaction elements for the software, it was very tempting to create new or advanced components. However, because time constraints were so limiting, I learned the value of reusing or modifying our existing design patterns. Because the design system was being created in tandem, it was wasteful to experiment, update and push the design system, and have the developers update the code accordingly.<br><br>
                        
                        To solve this, I isolated every component in the interface, and wrote variables for every reused property. Any property that was not reused, I omitted or modified so that it could be. <span class="highlight">We then created a bespoke solution to act as the template for all future projects, as well as a CSS library that the developers could reference throughout the development phase.</span> This way, instead of having current and future developers depending on me for documentation for new or updated components, I could update the CSS library and solution myself and <span class="highlight">the changes would be instantly applied to all existing projects.</span> This was also a huge learning opportunity for me as a UX Engineer, as I learned to create code that other developers could immediately understand and implement. </p>
        
                        <p><b>Balancing Time and Quality</b></p>
                        <p>In past projects, I have had months to research and plan, months to design, months to develop, and months to test, release, and revise. This is the first time I have ever experienced an intense design and development sprint. I was given the requirements for 1 - 3 pages per day and then expected to create a high-quality design and convert them to a functional app within 1 - 2 days. The bespoke solution and CSS library helped with this immensely, as my design components eventually became repetitive and easy to implement. From this experience I learned that I can work under pressure and adapt quickly without sacrificing quality.<br><br>
                        
                        If I had more time on this project, I would have concentrated my efforts in the prototyping and wireframing phases. There were numerous times that I had to go back and update previous pages due to fast-developing design systems. There were also a few instances where components were being designed and developed so quickly, that I overlooked certain accessibility requirements. Finally, I would have spent more time on documentation so that I could review as the project ends. All in all, the trade off was necessary and I am still proud of the work I did.</p>
