            <span class="span-bold d-block mb-3r mt-3r">Problem</span>
            <p class="mt-3">Zoe’s website had been quickly put together in order to inform users. Outdated information, a harsh color palette, a complex user flow, and a lack of brand consistency all contributed to major usability issues. The site averaged 1 to 3 users per day, and users reported the website as slow and incomplete. I needed to design a new set of constraints in order to elevate the brand and accommodate limited project resources.<br><br>

            <span class="highlight">This project's problem was unique: customers were expected to cycle out after 2 - 4 year periods.</span> The users were expected to be almost equal students to locals, so the new website needed to target multiple demographics. We conducted small surveys on campus to determine what guests came to Zoe for: dine-in, coffee, a spot to study, etc. We found most users came to dine-in and were primarily women (~60% of users interviewed). <br><br>
            
            Our goals were to:

                <ul class="pl-3r">
                    <li>Launch a site that is informative and easy to navigate for all audiences</li>
                    <li>Elevate the interface to complement the new brand image</li>
                    <li>Convert users to in-person dining customers</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            We started with user personas of our primary and secondary target audiences to prepare.

                <b>Elevating a Brand</b><br><br>
                Knowing that the business was primarily targeting a younger, technology-driven audience, I intended to elevate the current brand and aim to impress. The owners had recently opened in a new location with a more modern experience compared to the previous “rustic” environment of their previous locations. After we discussed user flow, I began prototyping while preparing my ideas for the interface design. <br><br>

                I used deep, rich browns to match their exclusive, high-quality coffee while keeping consistent with the restaurant’s dark chestnut interior. We omitted red from the color palette, as it felt intrusive to the inviting color scheme. Pulling heavy influence from the interior of the building, the final design was the digital embodiment of the physical remodel.

                Overall, this was a rewarding project to work on as I was able to add and prove my value as a designer and developer. Some key takeaways that stuck with me over the years to come:<br><br>

                <b>Opportunity to grow</b><br><br>
                Not only was this project important because it was the customers' biggest complaint, but it also created enormous value to the business. We saw this project as an opportunity to informally announce the restaurant’s new business model, easily reserve dine-ins, and contact the owners with concerns and suggestions. Numerous guests have complimented the owners on how unique the site is. <br><br>

                <span class="highlight">The restaurant has reported the most reservations and dine-ins per year than they have ever received previously, and the website scales with their success accordingly.</span> During the first 2 months after the website launch, we saw equal users between Seattle, Washington and Pullman, Washington as news of the remodel and redesign spread fast.
                <br><br>

                <b>Opportunity to learn</b><br><br>
                Being one of my first projects as a lead designer, I enjoyed the responsibility I was given. My success as a designer was dependent on the success of the business, creating a high-risk, high-reward scenario. I’m pleased with the win-win opportunity I was able to create. <br><br>

                This was also the first solo professional project I had as a developer. I had a better understanding of the limitations of websites upon project completion, overall modifying my pipeline as a designer. After this project, I extensively studied front-end development to better understand what can impact website speed, usability, and SEO.
                <br><br>

                <b>Looking back</b><br><br>
                Although this was a successful project, there are many components I would change. In the past, I created design systems after project release, rather than creating a base and building on top of it throughout the duration of the project. Because of this, I can see many button and input elements that lack necessary features - like disabled effects. Additionally, I didn't save my design iterations and notes, which I consider necessary for documentation. Nonetheless, the stakeholders and users are satisfied with the redesign.
